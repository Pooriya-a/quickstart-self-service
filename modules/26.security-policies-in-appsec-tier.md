## `frontend` Security Policy

### Policy label selector

The `app == frontned` policy label selector is used in the `frontend` security policy; this ensures that the security policy is only applied to the `frontend` workload. 

### Ingress Rules

The `frontend` security policy has the following ingress rules.

01. **Rule 0** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow ingress traffic from the `loadgenerator` endpoints on TCP port 8080. The `app == loadgenerator` endpoint selector is used in the rule to specify the source workloads.

02. **Rule 1** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow ingress traffic from the `ingress-nginx controller` endpoints on TCP port 8080. The `app.kubernetes.io/component == "controller" && app.kubernetes.io/name == "ingress-nginx` endpoint selector is used in the rule to specify the source workloads. The rule also has a namespace selector specified using [projectcalico.org/name](https://docs.tigera.io/v3.14/reference/resources/globalnetworkpolicy) label since the `ingress-nginx controller` is not in the same namespace as the `frontend` workload.

### Egress Rules

The `frontend` security policy has the following egress rules.

01. **Rule 0** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow egress on TCP port 80 to any destination

02. **Rule 1** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow egress on TCP port 9555 to the `adservice` endpoints. The `app == adservice` endpoint selector is used to specify the destination workloads.  

03. **Rule 2** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow egress on TCP port 7070 to the `cartservice` endpoints. The `app == cartservice` endpoint selector is used to specify the destination workloads.  

04. **Rule 3** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow egress on TCP port 5050 to the `checkoutservice` endpoints. The  `app == checkoutservice` endpoint selector is used to specify the destination workloads.  

05. **Rule 4** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow egress on TCP port 7000 to the `currencyservice` endpoints. The  `app == currencyservice` endpoint selector is used to specify the destination workloads.  

06. **Rule 5** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow egress on TCP port 3550 to the `productcatalogservice` endpoints. The  `app == productcatalogservice` endpoint selector is used to specify the destination workloads.  

07. **Rule 6** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow egress on TCP port 8080 to the `recommendationservice` endpoints. The   `app == recommendationservice` endpoint selector is used to specify the destination workloads.  

08. **Rule 7** - For the `frontend` endpoints, allow egress on TCP port 50051 to the `shippingservice` endpoints. The   `app == shippingservice` endpoint selector is used to specify the destination workloads.
