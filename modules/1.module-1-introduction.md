# Module 1 - Introduction

## Workshop Lab

The following lab will be used in this course. The lab has three namespaces: `hipstershop`, `yaobank`, and `bookinfo`. The applications in those namespaces belong to `tenant-1` and `tenant-2`. The `ingress-nginx` namespace hosts an ingress controller which will be used to connect to the applications through the respective frontend microservice for each application. The `ingress-nginx` and `kube-system` namespaces are owned by the platform and are managed independently of the tenant namespaces.
