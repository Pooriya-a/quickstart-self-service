# Connect Cluster to Calico Cloud

> ### Quick Access - [Lesson Lab Tasks](#Lesson-Lab-Tasks) 

In this lesson, the lab cluster will be connected to Calico Cloud. Follow the instructions in the lesson video to connect the cluster to Calico Cloud. Make sure you have a Calico Cloud account or a trial account before starting the module. Many Kubernetes distributions can be connected to Calico Cloud. In this lesson, an AKS cluster will be connected to Calico Cloud to demonstrate the steps involved in connecting a cluster. 

## Calico Cloud Managed Clusters
