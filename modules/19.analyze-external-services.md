# Analyze Traffic to External Services using Service Graph and Kibana

Kubernetes workloads may communicate with services external to the cluster. Outbound access should be protected using security policies. Calico `DNS Policy` can grant access to external services using domain names. Refer to [DNS Policy](https://docs.tigera.io/calico-enterprise/latest/network-policy/domain-based-policy) for more information on domain matching. 

The Service Graph and Kibana can be used to retrieve a list of domains for individual workloads. Domain names can be added to a `GlobalNetworkSet` and referred to in security policies to grant access to external services. 

## Analyze Traffic to External Services using the Service Graph

The Service Graph will represent connectivity to external services using the `Public network` or `Private network` icons depending on whether the workload connected to a public or private IP. The name of the `NetworkSet` or `GlobalNetworkSet` will be depicted in the Service Graph if configured for the respective domains.

## Analyze Traffic to External Services using Kibana

Kibana can be used to generate a summarized list of FQDNs for a given workload or group of workloads. The list of FQDNs can be incorporated into a `GlobalNetworkSet`

Use the `Top 10 External Domains` visualization to identify the external services the `hipstershop`, `yaobank` and `bookinfo` namespaces communicate to. 

> Kibana DNS external domains

```
client_namespace: "bookinfo" or client_namespace: "hipstershop" or client_namespace: "yaobank"

```
