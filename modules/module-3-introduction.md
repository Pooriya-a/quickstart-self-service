# Introduction - Security Policy Framework for Zero-Trust Micro-segmentation

In this module, a security policy framework will be developed to secure the tenants and applications. Calico offeres a powerful policy model that can be used to implement a hierarchical approach to security. Unlike traditional firewalls which implement security as traffic transits certain points in the network, Calico enforces security for each endpoint or workload in the cluster.
