# Security Policy Framework Overview

In this lesson a security policy framework will be developed to secure tenant-1 and tenant-2 namespaces. The framework will leverage `security policy tiers` to establish a hierarchical approach to security for the ![security domains](https://github.com/tigera-cs/quickstart-self-service/blob/main/modules/module-3-introduction.md) discussed in the previous lesson. 

## Security Policy Tiers

Tiers are a hierarchical construct used to group policies and enforce higher precedence policies that cannot be circumvented by other teams. Tiers can be used to establish a security policy framework. In this workshop, you will use four tiers listed below, and the default tier to to develop a security policy framework.
